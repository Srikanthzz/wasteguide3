    Hazardous waste is any waste material that poses substantial threats to public health and the environment due to its chemical, biological, or physical properties. Here are 10 tips for managing hazardous waste:

Preparation

1. Identify and categorize: Determine the type and quantity of hazardous waste generated (e.g., chemical, biological, radioactive).
2. Label and segregate: Separate hazardous waste from non-hazardous waste and label containers clearly.

Storage and Handling

1. Use compatible containers: Store hazardous waste in containers resistant to corrosion and leakage.
2. Secure storage areas: Restrict access, provide ventilation, and use spill containment measures.
3. Handle with care: Use personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow proper lifting techniques.

Treatment and Disposal

1. Choose authorized facilities: Dispose of hazardous waste at licensed treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs).
2. Consider recycling: Explore recycling options for hazardous materials like solvents, oils, and batteries.
3. Neutralize or stabilize: Treat hazardous waste to reduce toxicity or reactivity.

Regulatory Compliance

1. Comply with regulations: Familiarize yourself with local, national, and international regulations (e.g., RCRA, EPA).
2. Maintain records: Document generation, storage, treatment, and disposal activities.
