<b> Awareness Tips:  </b>
   <pre>     <b></b>
    <b>1. Reduce Consumption:</b> The best way to manage waste is to generate less of it. Be mindful of what you buy, avoid excess packaging, and opt for durable, reusable items instead of single-use products.

    <b>2. Recycle Properly:</b>  Sort recyclables like paper, plastics, glass, and metals according to local recycling guidelines. Clean and dry items before placing them in recycling bins to prevent contamination.

    <b>3. Compost Organic Waste:</b>  Compost food scraps, yard waste, and other organic materials to create nutrient-rich soil for gardening. Composting helps reduce landfill waste and enriches your garden naturally.

    <b>4. Use Reusable Bags and Containers:</b>  Replace disposable plastic bags and bottles with reusable cloth bags, containers, and water bottles to cut down on plastic waste.

    <b>5. Buy in Bulk:</b>  Purchasing items in bulk can reduce packaging waste and save money. Use reusable containers for bulk purchases to avoid unnecessary plastic or paper packaging.

    <b>6. Donate Unwanted Items:</b>  Before throwing away items you no longer need, consider donating them. Clothes, furniture, electronics, and other goods can be reused by others, reducing waste.

    <b>7. Avoid Single-Use Plastics:</b>  Choose products with minimal or recyclable packaging, and avoid single-use plastics like straws, cutlery, and plastic wrap, which contribute heavily to environmental pollution.

    <b>8. Implement Waste Segregation:</b>  Separate waste at the source (household, office, or industry) into categories like recyclables, compostables, and non-recyclables to streamline the recycling process and reduce contamination.

    <b>9. Support Sustainable Products and Services:</b>  Choose products made from sustainable materials, as well as those with eco-friendly packaging, and support companies and services that prioritize sustainability in their operations.
