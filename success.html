Navjeevan Vihar colony in New Delhi has achieved remarkable success as a zero-waste colony. This transformation began in 2017 when the Municipal Corporation of Delhi visited the colony to raise awareness about waste management ¹.

The residents, led by Dr. Bhairavi Hiremath, implemented effective waste management techniques. They started segregating waste into categories, including wet waste, garden scraps, plastic waste, and pre-loved clothes. The wet waste was converted into compost, reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills.

Key Achievements:
- 10,000 kg of compost produced annually from wet waste ¹
- 600,000 kg of waste diverted from landfill sites ¹
- Nine rainwater harvesting systems built around the colony ¹

The colony's success inspired the creation of the Vikalp Stores project, which aimed to reduce single-use plastic bags. The project introduced reusable cloth bags, available for a refundable deposit of ₹20. This initiative expanded to 750 stores across Delhi, promoting sustainable practices ¹.
